The brief was rather broad only providing a context and a word; my job was to create a book combing them both. I had ‘Water’ for my word and ‘Social for context, my idea was based on complaining about rain. I made a concertina book about the different phrases we use to describe it and illustrations to demonstrate them.
&lt;/div&gt;

This is an editorial brief I had to work on using body copy from a Typeradio interview with Morag Myerscough. I had to design a spread that would mimic the tone of the interview and reflect Morags persona.

This was a live brief set over a week from a local design company CHS, working in a team to create an Identity for a new premium/urban restaurant. The guidelines were quite specific and the menu requirements had to be considered to suit a wide target audience.
